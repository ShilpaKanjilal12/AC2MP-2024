                    The fourth edition of this distinguished series, AC2MP 2024, organized by the Department of Physics
                    at the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, is designed to bring together experts from the field of
                    condensed matter physics and allied communities across the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

                <p>The Department of Physics at IIT Patna was established and began its activities in August 2008 to
                    train undergraduate engineering students. In July 2009, the department initiated a Ph.D. program in
                    various frontier fields of Physics. The M. Tech program in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology ran in the
                    department from July 2012 until July 2019. The department has been offering a 2-year M. Sc. program
                    in Physics since July 2016 and a 4-year B. Tech in Engineering Physics from July 2021. Committed to
                    engaging in high-quality research and the pursuit of excellence in teaching, the faculty members of
                    the department are actively involved in research and development in challenging areas of both theory
                    and experiment. Currently, the main research emphasis of the department comprises Condensed Matter
                    Physics, Quantum Physics, Optics, Biophysics, Atomic & Molecular Physics, and High-energy physics.
                </p>

                <p>Nestled in the historical city of Patna in the State of Bihar, surrounded by cultural richness and
                    academic excellence, it is anticipated that the active participation of attendees will enhance the
                    conference experience and contribute significantly to the global discourse on condensed matter
                    physics.</p>
